The best way to build your side project is the same as the best way to build products used by millions of people:

**start with a super basic MVP. Minimize the time between [designing the solution] and [using the tool to solve your problem].** You can iterate from there.

The benefits are mostly the same as well, with one big difference. Motivation is _crucial_ to keeping a side project alive; less so for a mature product. Best motivational boost? Using your side project to solve the problem that inspired it.
