# Hey, HR: just post the salary bands online

A company reached out to me today, saying they were hiring. Here's a quote from the email:
>We're huge on transparency and documentation, from our company culture to compensation (!!), so¬†[I'll let our docs do the rest of the talking](https://www.notion.so/Curious-about-Otis-46df28b7e37c4b1fa5e4681a0efda4e4).

I clicked on the link, and two things stood out to me from the "Our Compensation" doc:
1. Public salary bands. Imma say that again. Public üëèüèΩsalary üëèüèΩ bands üëèüèΩ
2. The "Steps" tab

# Public salary bands
Anytime I've talked to someone in HR about making salary bands transparent, the concern has been that "money is too personal," and employees just can't handle receiving that information via a document.

Once, a friend of mine's employer decided that since CA law requires companies to share salary bands with prospective employees when asked, they should also give current employees that information.

Here was the process my friend went through:
1. Ask HR
2. HR scheduled a meeting with him, his manager, the head of HR, and another HR employee
3. He was shown the levels on a screen but was not allowed to write things down or take pictures

Meanwhile, Otis' process:

The benefit of public salary bands is two-fold. First, the company is more likely to compensate all employees equitably. Second, all employees will feel not just fairly compensated, but more fairly _valued_ every day that they come into work. After all, what would make you feel more respected by your employer: the first process or the second?

# The Steps Tab
There is a tab in that compensation & levels doc at the very end called "Steps." And it details how an individual should progress from level 1 to level 2, etc. Why is this exciting? The number one career block I've seen for folks is the transition from IC to Management. Tell me if this sounds familiar:

Your team lost its manager or has grown so big that it needs to be split into two. Y'all start picking up the managerial slack. Maybe it's relatively evenly split. Maybe there's one person on your team who seems to enjoy more managerial work and takes more of it on. They're coding less, but they're filling the executive shoes. Finally, someone is tasked with finding a manager for your team. Who gets selected? The person who's been filling the managerial role? Or the super-driven IC who loves writing code all day? The latter. Who would be a better manager? The former. Who's gonna leave the team (or worse, the company) in the next year? The former. And, honestly? Possibly the latter too.

I've seen this story happen over and over again. My theory is this: companies haven't thought clearly about what makes a good pre-manager. They'll swear up and down that "the skills needed for management are vastly different from the skills needed as an IC," but when the chips are down, and they lack guidelines to follow, they'll grasp for the person excelling most in their current role, not the person showing the skills they need.

Having a clear path to help the employee and manager come to a concrete agreement on career progression can be crucial. This Steps tab isn't the perfect solution for it: I think it could _strongly_ benefit from a transition plan for ICs interested in trying out management. But it's a huge first step. I don't think I've seen this kind of guidance on improving through your band before.

# The Inclusion Win
There's a not-so-secret benefit to these additions. Those of you who've worked in Diversity/Equity/Inclusion/Belonging initiatives might see it right away. Who suffers most from hidden salary bands? Under-represented minorities. Who hits the IC-to-Manager glass wall most? Under-represented minorities.

When you solve these issues, you create not just a happier workplace, but a more equitable one.
