this post neither avoids nor indulges in spoilers


Any movie you watch, there are phases that your brain moves through. Most movies you don't notice: it's the goal of the movie to take you on a journey without you noticing it. But there's a genre of movie that makes you aware of your brain. You notice yourself feeling confused, recognizing things, recognizing that you probably should recognize things. You notice yourself noticing. Notice yourself understanding. Notice yourself giving up and letting the film wash over you.

# The stages of watching "I'm thinking of ending things"

## 1. Collecting the vibes
- Hm. Okay. This is definitely the atmosphere I was expecting. Kinda slice of life indie deep-thought vibe.
- Except with an underlying sense of...dread?
- This movie is shot kinda like a horror movie. But without the horror.
- Is he the janitor? No, they have very different noses.
- I wonder if this entire movie will be set inside of this car.

## 3. Confusion _begins_ to creep in
- That was weird
- Why would you go for a walk?
- Ooh, I like her earrings
- Yeah it really is shot like a horror movie.
- Hang on, did the dad get younger? Did the mom get older?

## 3. Vibe check: overthrown. You notice your own confusion as you take in as much information as possible
- Was she wearing pearls before?
- Aha! That's right, she couldn't have been wearing pearls before, because I liked these earrings.
- What the heck is going on
- WHAT is that PHONE CALL
- Her occupation, name, stories, they all keep changing
- Yeah, girl, get out and go home. This will all go away once you get home.
- Okay...what. No, don't make any stops, just GO HOME
- What does the ice cream girl mean?

## 4. You begin to create a narrative out of what you've seen so far
- Get out get out get out
- He's definitely the janitor
- Oh, I would be so upset
- Maybe she's the one with Alzheimer's. And she's remembering all her past days in this one.
- That would explain why he kept asking her if she wanted to go home to the farmhouse
- Aw it's the slippers
- Yeah, I think she's the one with Alzheimer's

## 5. Your previous narrative is smashed with a hammer
- Okay maybe not.
- I'm just gonna let this movie flow over me
- If he ends this movie like Synecdoche, New York, I'm gonna laugh
- Yeah, this kinda feels like the ending to Synecdoche, New York
- Apparently that's the ending to "A Beautiful Mind"? Which must make this something from "Oklahoma"?
- Which vehicle was that? The truck or the car?
- Huh. It started up again. What's that supposed to mean? I'm going to ignore it.

## 6. You begin to gather your thoughts and conclusions with those who watched with you
- It does kinda feel like the woman has Alzheimer's. Until the dancers.
- What's the deal with all the quoting of other material _inside_ of this material?
- Maybe it's two stories about two people. The first half about the woman, the second about the man.

## 7. You go back to your everyday life.
Usually after a movie of this genre, the question "How would the director shoot this everyday activity I'm doing right now?" arises every so often. However with this movie, the vibes change so dramatically across the movie that no such ideas come to mind.

## 8. Occasionally, you swap new considerations with those who saw the movie with you. Your brain continues to chew on the movie.
- Maybe it is all about the janitor. Maybe the inner voice of the woman is actually from the man. Now I kinda wanna see it again.
- It does kinda make sense given that you see the janitor from the beginning. But then the interactions other characters have _just_ with the woman don't really make sense.
- The breaking of the fourth wall...in her stare. So many   pieces.
