>Finally, why don't they offer equity to users who make a contribution to their success? I know how VC-backed companies work, I spent 25 years in Silicon Valley in the business. In all these networks there's a line between the slaves, the people who use the system and get no compensation, and the employees who make lots of money and get stock options, and if it's successful can get rich even if their individual contribution wasn't pivotal. I'd be more willing to pour my creativity and time into the system if there was some upside other than satisfaction. I am all stocked up on satisfaction. I'd like to play for real money.

I'd love to see this. How do you incentivize the cornerstone to your platform's virality: high quality content? Many a blockchain project has spun up attempting to answer that question with tokens. Steem comes to mind as an example. But the direct link between your content's popularity and money is too corruptible, it seems. Content on Steem, much like content on Medium has started to be, trended short and vacuous. Stock is an interesting idea compared to tokens because it ties more to the quality of the platform. If the platform does well -- not just your content -- you do well. But then you get into securities law and whatnot. I wonder if you could go a Sia token route. Give someone tokens that pay dividends for high quality content.
